# Self-Care-App
Java application, which is motivated by the importance of self care and self love. It allows creating accounts, getting motivational quotes, and adding, filtering, and sorting personal journals. There are a set of commands that can be executed in the console after starting the application. Important functionalities that I learned from the MJT course are to be seen in the implementation as well as good architecture, clean code conventions and unit tests.

### Commands
- **register** - _if `<username>` is free_
``` shell
$ register <username> <password>
```
- **log in** - _if `<username>` and `<password>` are correct_
``` shell
$ login <username> <password>
```
- **log out** - _if user is logged_
``` 
$ logout
```
- **create new journal**
``` shell
$ create-journal <title> <content>
```
- **list all journals** - _all journals of current user_
``` shell
$ list-all-journals
```

``` shell
$ find-by-title <title>
```
- **find by keywords** - _ordered by the occurences (desc)_
``` shell

```
- **find by date** - <date> _in format YYYY-MM-DD_
``` shell
$ find-by-date <date>
```
- **sort by title**
``` shell
